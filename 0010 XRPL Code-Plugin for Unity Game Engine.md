# XRPL Code-Plugin for Unity Game Engine

**Category:** Game Development

**Proposed Amount:** $3,000

## Overview

[Unity](https://www.unity.com/) is the most popular game engine for indie developers and mobile games. It's a cross-platform engine used to build real-time 3D projects for various industries across games, animation, automotive, architecture, and more.

In-app payments and NFTs for games have been on the rise and there’s no Unity code-plugin that supports native integration on the XRPL. Tackling this use case for this popular game engine can further grow the XRPL ecosystem to include more games built on the XRPL and increase XRPL game developers.

Especially with XLS-20 (NFT feature on XRPL) soon to be added to mainnet, it’ll be beneficial to create an XRPL code-plugin for Unity to easily integrate in-app game payments and NFT trading on the XRPL.

## Milestones
