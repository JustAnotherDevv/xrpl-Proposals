# Welcome to XRPL Bounties!

This is where you can find bounties to work on, propose new ideas for bounties, or add your thoughts to the discussion!
Hopefully this program helps us:
* Give new contributors meaningful projects to tackle
* Fill in the gaps in the XRPL ecosystem
* And get help from various experts on problems which require domain expertise!

All while paying people for the contributions they make.

# Pick Up a Bounty

Approved bounties can be found above as .md files in this repo.

(Pull requests are NOT approved bounties - they are still pending review and approval)

Every bounty will describe the problem, what the work entails, and how much money will be awarded on completion.

Bounty work is split into milestones, which split the work into incremental features, each of which is worth a piece of the total bounty. The first milestone is often required, while the rest are valuable add-ons.

If you see a bounty you like in the repo, feel free to get started!

<br>

# Submit a Bounty

Once youâ€™ve completed a milestone, you can submit to claim that piece of the bounty by filling out this form: https://ripplelabs.typeform.com/bounty-program

> Note: You must be over 18 years old and you must not be on a sanctions list or within a sanctioned country in order to receive a bounty. <br> This compliance requirement also extends to your teammates.

Be aware that in order to validate that you are eligible to receive payment, you will need to share your real name when trying to claim a bounty.

# Propose New Bounty Ideas

If you see a problem that it would be great for someone in the community to tackle, please propose it!

The easiest way to get started with proposing a new bounty idea is to create a new discussion topic for your idea. That way you can see what other community members think, and have some space to think through some potential solutions.

Before you post though, make sure to do a cursory search to see if the idea has already been proposed! <br> 
(If it has, just add your thoughts to that discussion ðŸ™‚) <br>
https://github.com/XRPLBounties/Proposals/discussions

Otherwise, if the idea hasnâ€™t been shared before, feel free to create a new discussion post! <br> https://github.com/XRPLBounties/Proposals/discussions/new?category=ideas

After a week or two of discussion, you can create a PR with a formal proposal in it. Use the `bounty_proposal_template.md` file as a template in order to make sure all the required information is available to future bounty hunters! (There may be some back and forth with bounty maintainers in order to fully flesh out a robust and fair bounty)

Once the PR is merged, the bounty is live and anyone can pick it up!

# Join The Discussion

Even if all you want to do is browse, you can help us out by adding your perspective to the various discussions!
