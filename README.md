# Ideas / Proposals

This repository is used to propose and discuss ideas for bounties.

1. Initial proposal: anyone can publicly share an idea by creating a [Discussion in the Ideas category](https://github.com/XRPLBounties/Proposals/discussions/categories/ideas).

2. Formal proposal: anyone can publicly draft the formal requirements for a bounty by opening a Pull Request (PR).

3. PR reviews are used to determine which bounties are approved to move to the next stage.

4. If approved, the bounty will have a budget set aside for it, and the PR will be merged into this repo and mirrored to the `Bounties` repo (to be created).
